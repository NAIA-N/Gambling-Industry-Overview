# Gambling Industry Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the gambling industry's gross gambling yield over a period of several years. The analysis focuses on exploring trends, patterns, and key insights within the industry using data visualization and statistical techniques.

## Project Background

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the trends in the gambling industry's gross gambling yield over time. The dataset used for this analysis includes data from multiple sectors within the industry and spans several years. The analysis aims to provide insights into the industry's growth, sector contributions, and potential factors influencing its performance.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from the Gambling Commission, and it includes information about various sectors within the gambling industry, their contributions to the overall yield, and the reporting periods. The dataset has been cleaned and processed to ensure data quality and accuracy.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Import and Cleaning: The raw data was imported from the Excel file and underwent cleaning procedures to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format columns appropriately.
2. Data Visualization: Various data visualization techniques were used to visualize the overall trend in gross gambling yield, sector contributions, yearly growth rates, and more.
3. Linear Regression: A linear regression analysis was performed to quantify the overall trend in the gross gambling yield over time.


## Key Findings

1. The overall trend in the gross gambling yield shows a statistically significant positive growth over time based on the results of the linear regression analysis.
2. The COVID-19 pandemic had a noticeable impact on the industry, with a significant decline in gambling yield observed during the pandemic period compared to previous years.
3. Sector contributions varied over time, with some sectors showing more growth than others.

## Future Analysis

Possible avenues for future analysis include:
- Time series forecasting to predict future trends in the gambling yield.
